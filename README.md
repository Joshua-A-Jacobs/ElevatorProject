# ElevatorProject
# Joshua Jacobs

This project is intended to simulate an elevator. On running, it will request user input and based on that input, go to a floor much like an elevator.

Input controls:

Simply putting in a number is to simulate being inside the elevator and pushing a button. 
Example: Inputting "5" will take you to the fifth floor, "9" to the ninth floor, so on.

Putting in "call" followed by a number and direction is to simulate pushing a button waiting outside at a specific floor for the elevator.

Example: Inputting "call 5 down" will bring the elevator to the fifth floor with the intention of going down. It will skip over this floor if it is currently going to a floor above you.
Another example would be "call 0 up", this would be calling the elevator at the ground floor with the intention of going up.
